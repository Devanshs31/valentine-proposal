# valentine-proposal
Overview:

This project is a playful and interactive Valentine's Day proposal webpage featuring a humorous unclickable "No" button. When the user attempts to click the "No" button, it moves away, providing a fun and surprising experience. The "Yes" button leads to a second page where a cute animated GIF and a heartfelt message are displayed.

Features:

1. Unclickable "No" Button: The "No" button moves away when clicked, adding an element of surprise and humor.
2. Heartwarming Proposal: A playful message asking "Can I be your Boyfriend?" is presented.
3. Responsive Design: The page adjusts to various screen sizes for mobile and desktop devices.
4. Valentine's Day Theme: Bright colors and cute GIF animations enhance the romantic and playful atmosphere.

Technologies Used:

1. HTML: Structure of the webpage
2. CSS: Styling and layout, including responsiveness for different screen sizes
3. JavaScript: Used to create the interactive and unclickable "No" button functionality

How It Works:

The first page features two buttons:
A "Yes" button that redirects to a second page when clicked.
A "No" button that moves away when the user tries to click it, making it unclickable and playful.
The second page features a heartfelt proposal message and an animated GIF.

Customization:

You can modify various aspects of the project:

Text: Update the text in the HTML files (index.html and next.html) to personalize the message.
Animations: The button movement and GIF can be adjusted by modifying the JavaScript and CSS files.
Design: Customize colors, fonts, and images in the CSS for a personalized touch.
